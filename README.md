# Red-Black-Tree

The goal of this project is to complete the code for insertions in a Red-Black Tree. The insertion into a Red-Black-Tree follows the 4 main laws, which are: 

Every node has a color, red or black. 
The root is always black. 
If the node is red, its children must be black. 
Every path from a node to every null must traverse the same number of black nodes.

In order to follow these 4 laws, trees rotations play a crucial role into keeping every align.

This project highlights the understanding of a binary search tree, tree traversals, and the importance of choosing the right and appropriate data structure for a task.
